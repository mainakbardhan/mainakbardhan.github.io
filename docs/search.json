Jawahar Lal Nehru Memorial Medical College through the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) Short Term Studentship (STS)program. His initial work focused on Sickle Cell Anemia at the Department of Biochemistry and the Sickle Cell Institute in Chhattisgarh, laying a strong foundation in disease-oriented research.\nThroughout medical school, he actively pursued diverse research experiences, serving as a Medical Student Research Trainee at the CSIR–Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB), Hyderabad and CSIR–Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (IGIB), New Delhi, where he also worked as a Visiting Medical Student. These experiences broadened his exposure to molecular biology, genomics, and translational research."
